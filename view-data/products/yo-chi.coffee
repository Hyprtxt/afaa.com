  description: [
    'In Yo-Chi, Lawrence Biscontini sets out to “create a mind-body, cafeteria-style bento box, dim sum sampler” of some of Lawrence’s favorite and most effective standing and floor-based yoga postures with Chinese Ta’i Chi movement patterns for the arms and legs. It’s a fusion program that gives you benefits in both stability or strength and mobility or flexibility as Lawrence combines the two oldest mind body programs that still exist today. So much of yoga depends on being still and finding stability, and so much of T’ai Chi involves slow, controlled never ending mobility, but by doing these disciplines together– either alternating or in combination–can help increase your overall wellness. Furthermore, the fact that these two disciplines have survived for hundreds of years attests to the fact they truly offer something for everyone. Yo-Chi is perfect for teaching both the new-to fitness sedentary couch potato and the experienced elite.'
