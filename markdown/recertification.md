# AFAA Recertification

AFAA certification demonstrates a commitment to excellence. As part of this commitment, AFAA certifications must be renewed every two years. Another option is to **Certify for Life**, where you can pay a one-time fee upfront instead of every two years.

In order to recertify, you must earn at least 15 [continuing education units (CEUs)](/courses#continuing-education), and at least 2 of these CEUs must be from AFAA developed courses. All other CEUs may be earned through additional AFAA courses and/or AFAA approved provider courses. If you have coursework that is not pre-approved you may fill out a [petition application](/docs/default-source/default-document-library/afaa-ceu-petition-application.pdf) for CEU review and approval.

Once you have earned your CEUs, you will need to [fill out the AFAA Renewal Application](/docs/default-source/default-document-library/afaa-recertification-application.pdf) and submit it along with a renewal fee. You will also need to hold a current CPR/AED certification in order to recertify with AFAA (online CPR/AED certifications will not be accepted).

How to Apply:

**Step 1:** [Complete the AFAA Renewal Application](/docs/default-source/default-document-library/afaa-recertification-application.pdf)

* [Certify for Life plus late fee*, $349](https://shop.nasm.org/addtocart.aspx?productid=9244)

**Step 3:** Submit your documentation by mail. Please include:

1. The AFAA Renewal Application (with proof of a name change if applicable.)
1. A copy of the documents that validate your earned CEUs.

Please note payments and applications are processed separately. Payments are processed immediately upon receipt. Please allow 30 days for the application to be processed.

\* *A late fee is required (per certificate) for applications received 1-180 days after the certificate expiration date.*

**Reinstatement Options:**

We no longer offer a reinstatement option. Past AFAA certified professionals whose Group Exercise Instructor or Personal Fitness Trainer certifications has lapsed for 180 days or longer will need to repurchase the Personal Fitness Trainer Certification exam or Group Exercise Instructor Certification exam. Please contact an AFAA Education Advisor to discuss your options at 800-446-2322, Option 1.
