# AFAA Recertification

AFAA certification demonstrates a commitment to excellence. As part of this commitment, AFAA certifications must be renewed every two years.

In order to recertify, you must earn at least 15 continuing education units (CEUs), and at least 2 of these CEUs must be from AFAA developed courses. All other CEUs may be earned through additional AFAA courses and/or AFAA approved provider courses. If you have coursework that is not pre-approved you may fill out a [petition application](#) for CEU review and approval.

Once you have earned your CEUs, you will need to [fill out the AFAA Renewal Application](#)  and submit it along with a renewal fee. You will also need to hold a current CPR/AED certification in order to recertify with AFAA (online CPR/AED certifications will not be accepted).

How to Apply:

**Step 1:** [Complete the AFAA Renewal Application](#)
