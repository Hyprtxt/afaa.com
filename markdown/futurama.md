## You lived before you met me?!

Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Bite my shiny metal ass. No! The cat shelter's on to me. I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.

And then the battle's not so bad? Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! __Ah, yes!__ *John Quincy Adding Machine.* He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.

### Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.

Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. No! Don't jump! Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?

1. It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.
2. That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.
3. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.

#### Bender, we're trying our best.

When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. Why yes! Thanks for noticing. Who are those horrible orange men? Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men.

* Hello, little man. I will destroy you!
* I love you, buddy!
* That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"?

Belligerent and numerous. I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Oh yeah, good luck with that. Who are you, my warranty?!

For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Why not indeed! Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Who are you, my warranty?!

Can I use the gun? I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very…

Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. With gusto. Fry, we have a crate to deliver.

Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Do a flip! Of all the friends I've had… you're the first.

Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. Why yes! Thanks for noticing. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. When will that be?

Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. It's toe-tappingly tragic! Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!

I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?

Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? It must be wonderful. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Anyone who laughs is a communist!

WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?

Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. That's not soon enough! Bender?! You stole the atom. I'll get my kit! Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.
