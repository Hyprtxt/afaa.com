NASM is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on Web sites outside of the NASM and NASM family of Web sites

### Use of your Personal Information

NASM collects and uses your personal information to operate the NASM Web site and deliver the services you have requested. NASM also uses your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from NASM, its Affiliates and selected Partners. “Affiliates” —means a corporation, partnership, Limited Liability Company or other entity that has some common ownership with NASM. "Partner" —means a corporation, partnership, Limited Liability Company or other entity that has a business relationship with NASM. NASM may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered

NASM does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties but may provide such information to its Affiliates and Partners. NASM or its Affiliates and Partners may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external or internal business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party without your permission. In addition, NASM may share data with Affiliates and trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to NASM, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information. You acknowledge and agree that your certification status is not confidential information and that NASM may disclose your current certification status, including expiration dates, to third parties

NASM does not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as race, religion, or political affiliations, without your explicit consent

NASM keeps track of the Web sites and pages our customers visit within NASM, in order to determine what NASM services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within NASM to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area

NASM will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on NASM or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of NASM; and (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of NASM products or property, or to protect the public

### Use of Cookies

The NASM Web site uses "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize NASM pages, or register with an NASM site or services, a cookie helps NASM to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses and so on. When you return to the same NASM Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the NASM features that you customized

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the NASM services or Web sites you visit

### Security of your Personal Information

NASM secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. NASM secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol

### Changes to this Statement

NASM will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. NASM encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed as to how NASM is protecting your information

### Contact Information

NASM welcomes your comments regarding this Statement of Privacy. If you believe that NASM has not adhered to this Statement, please contact NASM at nasmcares@nasm.org. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and remedy the problem.
